      <p class="paragraph">
      Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a clown fish who is overly protective of his son, Nemo. When Nemo swims too close to the surface of the sea, he is caught by a diver. Marlin must set out on the seas to find him. On his journey he meets a blue reef fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) with a really bad memory. She joins Marlin on his quest as they encounter sharks, turtles and a host of ocean dangers. Meanwhile, Nemo masterminds an escape from his captor.
